#LuxRender v. 1.5 Release Notes

This version includes vast enhancements to the LuxCore architecture. When using LuxCore LuxRender can render a scene six times faster than the previous version, when using the CPU. With the addition of an OpenCL GPU furhter speed improvements can be achieved. 

LuxCore needs to be enabled by the exporter that you use so check with the exporter if it provides support for this feature.

##Installation

- If you want to use the command-line tools, included with LuxRender, execute the script `create_systemwide_symlinks` in the LuxRender/interactive_script folder. That will give you access to all the tools, like luxconsole, from everywhere in the Terminal
- There are some pre-configured scripts that can be used to start useful services ( guided ), like the node renderer, by simply double-clicking on them from Finder.
